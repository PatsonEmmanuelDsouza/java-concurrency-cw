# Java CPU Task Scheduler Simulator

## Coursework Project â€“ Operating Systems & Concurrency (Java)

This project was developed as part of a university coursework focused on **Operating Systems** and **Java Concurrency**. The goal was to simulate a **non-preemptive CPU task scheduler**, managing multiple processes on a single-core CPU.

## Project Objective

To implement a CPU scheduling simulation that:
- Manages tasks in a **non-preemptive** scheduling environment
- Uses **Java concurrency** to simulate realistic task behavior and timing
- Demonstrates understanding of **process management**, **thread handling**, and **OS-level scheduling concepts**

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Java
- Java Threads & Synchronization
- OOP principles
